3. **How**: "Just accept the agreement to join"
4. **Safety**: "We take misconduct seriously"

**Sample announcement**:
```
🔒 New Safety Feature

We're adding gender-aware trip composition to help you make 
informed decisions about your travel companions. You'll see 
how many males/females are in each trip before joining.

We've also implemented a clear community code of conduct with 
zero tolerance for misbehavior. This ensures Travel-Mate 
remains a safe platform for everyone.

Just agree to our community guidelines before joining - it takes 
less than a minute!

Safe travels! 🌍✈️
