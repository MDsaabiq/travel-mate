## For Developers

### Testing the Features

#### 1. Test Gender Demographics Display
```bash
# Start backend and frontend
npm start  # in both backend and frontend directories

# Navigate to trip details page
# You should see a "Trip Composition" card in the sidebar
# showing gender breakdown
```

#### 2. Test Disclaimer Modal
```bash
# On trip details page
# Click "Join Trip" button
# Disclaimer modal should appear
# Try clicking "I Agree & Join Trip" without checking box (should be disabled)
# Check the checkbox to enable button
```

#### 3. Test API Endpoint
```bash
# Terminal/Postman
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/trips/{TRIP_ID}/demographics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}"

# Expected Response:
# {
#   "demographics": {
#     "male": 3,
#     "female": 2,
#     "other": 0,
#     "total": 5
#   },
#   "status": "not_started"
# }
```

#### 4. Verify Gender Field in Users
```bash
# Check that user records have gender populated
# In MongoDB:
db.users.findOne({email: "user@example.com"})
# Should have: "gender": "male" or "female" or "other"
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Gender demographics show 0 for all

**Solution**:
1. Ensure users have gender field filled in their profiles
2. Check that participants are properly populated in trips
3. Verify demographics API endpoint is returning correct data

```javascript
// In browser console:
fetch('/api/trips/{TRIP_ID}/demographics')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log(d))
```

### Issue: Modal doesn't appear when clicking Join

**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify disclaimerModalOpen state is toggling
4. Ensure JoinDisclaimerModal component imported correctly

### Issue: "I Agree & Join Trip" button disabled even with checkbox

**Solution**:
1. Ensure checkbox onChange handler works
2. Check that `agreed` state updates properly
3. Verify isLoading prop is false
