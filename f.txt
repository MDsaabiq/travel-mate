Idea Description:

Identifying and nurturing sports talent in India is a major challenge, especially for athletes from rural and remote areas who do not have access to proper infrastructure or scouting opportunities. Existing systems are limited to physical trials that are resource-heavy, inconsistent, and do not provide a holistic view of an athleteâ€™s abilities. Our idea addresses this gap through an AI-powered mobile-first platform designed to democratize sports talent assessment.

The solution, Athlete360, allows athletes to register, record, and upload performance videos for standardized tests like shuttle runs, vertical jumps, sit-ups, and endurance runs. The app then uses AI-driven motion tracking (TensorFlow Lite + MediaPipe) to analyze posture, count repetitions, measure jump height, and detect anomalies to prevent cheating. This ensures fair, transparent, and scientific evaluation that works even on entry-level smartphones.

Once the performance is verified, the system compares results with age- and gender-based benchmarks. Scores above a certain threshold are flagged on the Sports Authority of India (SAI) dashboard for potential selection. If offline, data is stored locally and synced automatically when the device reconnects to the internet.

Beyond raw performance testing, the platform focuses on holistic athlete development. Features include:

AI Chatbot Coach (Dialogflow/Rasa): Gives real-time feedback, motivational nudges, and training recommendations in multiple Indian languages.

Learning Hub: Curated drills, video tutorials, and wellness modules covering physical training, mental health, and nutrition.

Diet & Fitness Tracking: Simple logs, hydration reminders, and integration with smartphone sensors or wearables.

Injury Risk Detection: AI posture analysis (MediaPipe + OpenCV) detects unsafe movements and alerts athletes before injuries occur.

Community Module: A social-media-like section where athletes share progress, achievements, and events.

Achievements & Events: Local sports organizers can register events, record winners by user ID, and reflect achievements directly on athlete profiles.

Leaderboards & Talent Maps: District, state, and national leaderboards powered by Firebase + Google Maps API visualize hidden talent pools across the country.


To ensure scalability and reliability, the backend is built on Firebase Firestore with Redis caching for fast data retrieval and real-time leaderboard updates. Load balancers and cloud functions distribute traffic to handle thousands of concurrent video uploads without performance loss. End-to-end encryption ensures data privacy and compliance with Indian laws like the Personal Data Protection Bill. SAI officials get a secure admin dashboard to manage athlete profiles, create assessments, and update guidelines.

The solution is designed to be affordable, accessible, and impactful:

Mobile-first approach ensures rural athletes can participate with just a smartphone.

Offline support reduces dependency on continuous internet access.

Gamified design (badges, milestones, leaderboards) keeps athletes motivated.

Integration with SAI and Khelo India ensures sustainability and real-world adoption.


In the long run, Athlete360 will create a centralized digital talent pool, reduce biases in selection, improve transparency, and give every athlete in India a fair chance to showcase their skills. It bridges the gap between raw talent and professional recognition, combining modern AI with accessible mobile technology to transform how India discovers its future champions.




 Abstract / Summary 

Abstract/Summary:

Athlete360 is an AI-powered mobile platform designed to democratize sports talent assessment in India. The system allows athletes to record and upload videos of standardized tests, which are then analyzed using AI motion tracking (TensorFlow Lite + MediaPipe) for rep counting, posture accuracy, and cheat detection. Performance is compared against age- and gender-based benchmarks, with top scorers flagged on the Sports Authority of India (SAI) dashboard.

The platform goes beyond raw performance by offering injury risk detection, fitness and diet tracking, mental wellness modules, and learning resources. A multilingual AI chatbot coach provides feedback and motivation, while leaderboards and talent maps highlight hidden athletes at district, state, and national levels. A community space enables athletes to share progress and achievements, and local events can directly reflect results on user profiles.

On the backend, Firebase + Redis caching ensures fast data storage and real-time leaderboard updates. Load balancers and cloud functions allow the system to handle large concurrent submissions, while end-to-end encryption guarantees data privacy and compliance. Officials access a secure web dashboard to manage athletes, assessments, and guidelines.

By making talent discovery affordable, scalable, and transparent, Athlete360 ensures rural athletes get equal opportunities to be identified and nurtured. This solution empowers the sporting ecosystem, aligns with Khelo India and SAI objectives, and has the potential to revolutionize how India discovers its next generation of champions.
