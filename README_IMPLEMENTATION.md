```
Creation → not_started (before trip date)
       ↓
     in_journey (during trip dates)
       ↓
       ended (after trip date) ← Automatic update!
```

### Review Availability
```
Reviews only available when:
- Trip status = "ended"
- User is trip participant
- User hasn't reviewed yet
```

### Trip Restart
```
Restart only available when:
- Trip status = "ended"
- User is trip organizer

Creates new trip with:
- Same details (title, itinerary, etc.)
- New dates
- Empty reviews
- Previous reviews stored for reference
```
