## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Backend Checks
```bash
# ✅ Verify models have correct enum
grep -n "enum.*join-request-pending" backend/models/Notification.js

# ✅ Verify join endpoint creates notification
grep -n "new Notification" backend/routes/trips.js

# ✅ Verify notifications populate sender and trip
grep -n "populate.*sender" backend/routes/notifications.js
```

### Frontend Checks
```bash
# ✅ Verify Chat component has responsive sidebar
grep -n "showSidebar" frontend/src/pages/Chat.tsx

# ✅ Verify Navbar has notification icons
grep -n "getNotificationIcon" frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx

# ✅ Build frontend for production
cd frontend && npm run build
```

### Database Checks
```bash
# ✅ Verify notification types
db.notifications.distinct('type')
# Should include: join-request-pending

# ✅ Cleanup old invalid notifications
db.notifications.deleteMany({
  type: { $nin: ['join-request-accepted', 'join-request-rejected', 'join-request-pending', 'new-message'] }
})
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Deployment
```bash
# Pull changes
git pull origin main

# Verify no conflicts
git status

# Install dependencies (if needed)
cd backend && npm install
cd frontend && npm install
```

### 2. Backend Deployment
```bash
# No database migrations needed
# Notification type added to enum, backwards compatible

# Restart backend server
npm start
# or
pm2 restart travel-mate-backend
```

### 3. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Verify dist folder created
ls -la dist/

# Deploy dist folder to hosting
# (CloudFlare, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Test Chat on Mobile
- [ ] Open app on phone
- [ ] Navigate to Messages
- [ ] Tap menu (☰) button
- [ ] Sidebar slides in
- [ ] Click trip - sidebar closes
- [ ] Send message - works ✓

#### Test Notifications
- [ ] Open as User A
- [ ] Click "Join Trip"
- [ ] Open as organizer
- [ ] See 🔔 notification
- [ ] Click notification
- [ ] Trip page loads without errors ✓

#### Monitor Logs
- [ ] Check backend logs for errors
- [ ] Check browser console (F12)
- [ ] Monitor database for queries
- [ ] Check API response times

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Restart services
npm start
```

### Database Recovery
```bash
# Restore from backup
mongorestore --uri="mongodb://..." dump/

# Or cleanup new notifications
db.notifications.deleteMany({ 
  type: 'join-request-pending' 
})
```

```

### Target After Deployment
```
Chat Page Load: ≤ 2.5s (acceptable)
Notification Fetch: ≤ 150ms (no regression)
Trip Details: ≤ 2.0s (same or better)
Join Request: ≤ 1.0s (with notification)
```
